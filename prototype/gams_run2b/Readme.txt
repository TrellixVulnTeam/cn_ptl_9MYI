This directory contains files prepared for MCMA.
The files are copied here from ../gams_run2a.
The zip-file uploaded to MCMA: cn_ptl_v2b.zip

The optimization/iters were run with diverse cplex.opt parameters (see a selection
in ../cplex_opt). Tightening tolerances and aggressive scaling improved the
numerical properties but the non-efficient solutions were still returned.
Therefore, the results were not imported from the MCMA server (but are available
there, as well as accessible through the MCMA app (problem cn_ptl_v2b).
