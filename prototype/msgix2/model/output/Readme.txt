Here the output gdx files shall be located. For the initial tests by JZ (with
scaled data only) two files are expected:
- cost_jz1.gdx  : results of minimization of COST_CUM
- co2_jz1.gdx  : results of minimization of CO2_CUM

Additionally the values of criteria should be added to the payoff.txt file
(initial version created).
