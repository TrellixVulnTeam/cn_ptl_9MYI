Here are the files used in Summer-2021 that should be used/adapted for the
current version. Original files should be kept here; modification should be
done in their copies located in the parent dir (i.e., ..../model)
- model_mca.gms should contain all model extensions for MCMA
- master.gms contains the master file (i.e., the file executed by gams called
  from the cmd-line).
